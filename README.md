# BattleTanks

An open world battle game built to help with learning c++ in Unreal by Ben Tristem
The game will include AI controlled tanks or player 2. 
Terrain will be used for cover to add challenge.
Different controls will be used so we can explore the way of setting them up.
Both tanks will start up with limited health and ammo.
The winner is the last tank standing.
